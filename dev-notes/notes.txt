migrations 
- add to package.json
  "db:generate": "drizzle-kit generate:pg" 

- can specify names for migrations 
  drizzle-kit generate --name init_db

New command: migrate
You can now apply generated migrations to your database directly from drizzle-kit
  drizzle-kit migrate 


------ Usage ------ 

create schema: 
  - define relations 
  - define linker tables for many-to-many relations 
generate migration 
  - npm run db:generate 
    - "db:migrate": "tsx src/drizzle/migrate.ts",

------------ docker ------------

Pulling the PostgreSQL Image
When you pull the PostgreSQL image and run it directly using Docker commands, you are manually managing the container. 
This approach is straightforward but requires more manual steps to configure and manage the container.

docker pull postgres
docker run --name local-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=example -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

Pros
Simplicity: Easy to understand and execute for simple use cases.
Direct Control: You have direct control over the container's lifecycle.

Cons
Manual Configuration: Requires manual setup and configuration for each container.
Limited Orchestration: Not suitable for managing multiple containers or complex setups.

Using Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to manage multiple 
services (containers) using a single YAML file (docker-compose.yml). This approach is more automated and scalable, 
making it easier to manage complex applications.

- Create a docker-compose.yml File in the root of directory:
    # version is no longer needed on Docker V2 projects which use 'docker compose' 
    version: '3.8' # version key specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format 

    services:                         # service name, each service runs a specific docker image
      postgres:
        image: postgres:latest
        container_name: postgres-db   # optional custom name for container 
        environment:                  # config for db container will create 
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
          POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase     # name of the database to be created
        ports:                        # maps ports on the host to ports on the container 
          - "5432:5432"
        volumes:                      # Mounts host directories or named volumes into the container. 
          - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data  # specified directory inside the container 

    volumes:                          # declares a named volume 
      postgres-data:

- run: docker-compose up -d

First Run:

  - When you run docker-compose up -d for the first time, Docker creates the postgres-data volume.
  - The PostgreSQL container initializes and creates the database drizzle-pg as specified in the environment variables.

Subsequent Runs:

  - On subsequent runs, Docker reuses the existing postgres-data volume.
  - The database drizzle-pg already exists in the volume, so it is not recreated.
  - If you want to force the creation of a new database, you would need to remove 
  the volume with docker volume rm postgres-data before running docker-compose up -d again

Pros
- Automation: Automates the setup and configuration of multiple containers.
- Orchestration: Manages the lifecycle of multiple services, including dependencies.
- Reusability: The docker-compose.yml file can be reused and shared across different environments.
- Scalability: Easily scale services up or down.

Cons
- Complexity: Slightly more complex to set up initially compared to running a single container.
- Learning Curve: Requires understanding of Docker Compose syntax and concepts.

Summary
- Pulling the PostgreSQL Image: Suitable for simple, single-container setups. Requires manual configuration and management.
- Using Docker Compose: Ideal for complex, multi-container applications. Provides automation, orchestration, 
  and scalability through a single configuration file.

connecting to db:
  Host: localhost
  Port: 5432
  Username: postgres
  Password: <your_password>
GUI tools: pgAdmin, DBeaver
can use psql for command line interaction 
  - Execute SQL Commands: Run SQL queries and commands to interact with the database.
  - Database Management: Create, modify, and delete databases and database objects like tables, indexes, and views.
  - Scripting: Write and execute scripts to automate database tasks.
  - Interactive Mode: Provides an interactive shell for real-time database interaction.
  - Batch Mode: Execute commands from a file or standard input.
  - commands: 
    connect: psql -h <host> -U <username> -d <database> 
    once connected: you can run sql statement in terminal: SELECT * FROM mytable;  
    exit: \q

integrating db to node.js project: 
1. Install pg Package: In your Node.js project, install the pg package to interact with PostgreSQL:
  npm install pg
2. Create a Database Connection: Create a file (e.g., db.js) to manage the database connection:
  ----------
  // db.js
  const { Pool } = require('pg');

  const pool = new Pool({
    user: 'postgres',
    host: 'localhost',
    database: 'mydatabase',
    password: 'example',
    port: 5432,
  });

  module.exports = pool;
  ------------

3. Use the Database Connection: Use the connection in your application:
  -------------

  // example.js
  const pool = require('./db');

  pool.query('SELECT NOW()', (err, res) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error executing query', err.stack);
    } else {
      console.log('Current time:', res.rows[0]);
    }
    pool.end();
  });

  -------------

----- services vs containers 

- Service: in Docker Compose a service  is a higher-level abstraction that defines how containers should be deployed and managed. 
  It specifies the configuration for running one or more containers of the same type.
  Purpose: Services are used to define and manage the lifecycle of containers in a multi-container application. They allow you to scale containers, manage dependencies, and configure networking.

Ex: both web and db are services 
services:
  web: # service name 
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example

- Container: A container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. It includes the application and its dependencies, and it runs in an isolated environment.
Purpose: Containers are used to run applications in a consistent environment across different systems. They encapsulate the application code, libraries, and runtime, ensuring that the application behaves the same way regardless of where it is run.
Example: When you run a Docker image, it creates a container. For instance, running docker run nginx creates a container from the Nginx image.

- Comparison 
Scope:
  Service: Defines a logical group of containers and their configurations in a docker-compose.yml file.
  Container: A single instance of a Docker image running in an isolated environment.

Management:
  Service: Managed through Docker Compose, which can scale the number of containers, manage dependencies, and configure networking.
  Container: Managed through Docker commands (docker run, docker stop, etc.) or by Docker Compose as part of a service.

Configuration:
  Service: Configured in the docker-compose.yml file, which can include multiple containers, networks, volumes, and other settings.
    To run multiple containers within a single service, you can use docker swarm by declaring the deploy field 
    and the number of instances of the container defined in the replicas section or be using the docker-compose up --scale command 
    To deploy multiple instances, Docker Swarm had to bi initialized first 
  Container: Configured through Docker commands or as part of a service definition in Docker Compose.

----- volumes
  - Volumes in Docker are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. 
  They are stored outside the container's filesystem, which means they are not affected by the 
  lifecycle of the container (e.g., when the container is stopped or removed, the data in the volume remains intact).

  - Creation: Volumes can be created explicitly using the docker volume create command or implicitly when declared in a docker-compose.yml file.
  - Mounting: Volumes are mounted into containers at specified paths. This is done using the volumes key in the docker-compose.yml file 
  or the -v flag in the docker run command.
  - Persistence: Data written to the volume is stored on the host machine and persists across container restarts and removals.
  - Sharing: Volumes can be shared between multiple containers, allowing them to read and write to the same data.

  - On a Windows machine, Docker volumes are typically stored in a specific directory managed by Docker. The default location is:
  C:\ProgramData\Docker\volumes
  - Each volume is stored in its own directory within this path. The directory name corresponds to the volume name or a unique 
  identifier if the volume was created without a specific name.

Commands 
docker-compose: This is the command used for Docker Compose v1. It is a standalone tool that you need to install separately from Docker.

docker compose: This is the command used for Docker Compose v2, which is integrated into the Docker CLI. It is available if you have Docker CLI v20.10.0 or later.

docker commands to run in project's root directory 
  - docker ps: check running containers 
  - docker compose ps                               : view running services 
  - docker compose logs                             : view logs for all services 
  - docker compose up -d --scale <service>=<number> : scale a service to a certain number of instances 
  - docker compose up -d                            : start all services, -d flag specifies 'detached mode' which means terminal will not be locked  
  - docker compose down                             : stop all running services 
  - docker volume create postgres-data              : create a volume 
  - docker volume ls                                : list volumes 
  - docker volume inspect postgres-data             : inspect a volume 
  - docker volume rm postgres-data                  : remove a volume 


Getting the database  URL 

get container name from config file or: 
docker compose ps

inspect container to get IPAddress 
docker inspect <container_name>

host = IPAddress
port = HostPort or found in config file 
  URL: "postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>."
  URL: "postgresql://drizzle:dev@172.18.0.2:5432/drizzle-pg"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHg0IJDl1RY
in this tutorial, he puts localhost as the <host> and after the database name he specifies 
the schema: <database name>?schema=public

If container is running on my local machine, connect with localhost :  URL: "postgresql://drizzle:dev@localhost:5432/drizzle-pg"
If it is running on a specific server, use your server IP. (For Windows docker-machine you probably need to use 192.168.99.100).

---------- trouble shooting --------

- bash seems slow running npm commands

------- nvm, npm, node --------- 
The location where nvm installs Node.js and npm is determined by the configuration of npm itself, not by nvm. By default, npm installs global packages in a directory under the user's profile, which is typically AppData\Roaming on Windows.

Explanation
nvm Directory: nvm itself is installed in /c/Users/nflores/.nvm, and it manages different versions of Node.js.
npm Global Packages Directory: When you install a global npm package, npm uses its own configuration to determine where to place these packages. By default, this is in the AppData\Roaming directory.
Why npm Uses AppData\Roaming
Default Configuration: npm's default configuration on Windows points to the AppData\Roaming directory for global installations. This is because the prefix configuration is set to a path under AppData\Roaming.
User Profile Synchronization: The Roaming directory is designed to synchronize user-specific data across different machines in a network domain, which can be useful for maintaining consistent environments.

--- bash commands while configuring npm installation --- 

$HOME is an env variable 
echo $HOME returns the value returned by $HOME 

env and printenv can be used to see all env variables and their values such as $APPDATA and $LOCALAPPDATA 

where can be used to find file paths 
where node returns where node.exe is installed 

echo $NVM_DIR: used to find where nvm is installed 

 where npm: the first time i ran where npm, i got four file paths: C:\Users\nflores\.nvm\versions\node\v22.6.0\bin\npm
C:\Users\nflores\.nvm\versions\node\v22.6.0\bin\npm.cmd
C:\Users\nflores\AppData\Roaming\npm\npm
C:\Users\nflores\AppData\Roaming\npm\npm.cmd 

following commands used to remove npm from Roaming/
rm -f "$APPDATA/npm/npm"
rm -f "$APPDATA/npm/npm.cmd"

check for hidden .nvm file 
where npm 
where node 
echo  $NVM_DIR
echo $HOME
npm ls 
 npm list -g --depth=0 : check for global dependencies 
echo $PATH
npm config get prefix
npm config list -l
